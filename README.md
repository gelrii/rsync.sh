# rsync

A simple user interface for rsync created in bash.

You can run this script quickly with the following command:
<pre>curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gelrii/rsync.sh/master/rsync.sh -o /tmp/rsync.sh && sh /tmp/rsync.sh</pre>

The above command uses curl, paste this into a terminal to execute it.

This script will allow you to que several rsync commands to the same directory.

# Proposed/Planned changes

- Allow the user to select whether multiple output files are wanted
- Allow the user to use tab completion when entering file names
- save the user from destroying file system
